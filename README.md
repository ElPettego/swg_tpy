# swg_tpy

## introduction
python compiler written in c++. i saw many transpilers of python but all they are written in python and i dont like. they are too slow. this attempt tries to increase speed of python. theoretically if it is possible to transpile every function of the standard python library it is possible to transpile to c++ every module. (correct me if i am wrong and explain why please)

## developement
u need to have make and run this command to compile and run
```
make && make run
```
